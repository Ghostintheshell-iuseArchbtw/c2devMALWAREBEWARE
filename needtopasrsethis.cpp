Certainly! Here’s a detailed dossier outlining the design, implementation, and operation of a dropper and payload system.
Dossier: Dropper and Payload System
1. Overview

The dropper and payload system is designed to illustrate the process of loading and executing a payload from memory. This document covers the implementation of both the dropper and the payload, including the design considerations, source code, and execution details. The primary goal is to provide a clear understanding of how to create a self-contained payload and a dropper capable of executing it directly from memory.
2. Components
2.1 Dropper

The dropper is a program responsible for loading the payload into memory, setting the appropriate memory permissions, and executing it. It operates in the following steps:

    Read Payload Binary Data: The dropper reads the payload binary data from a file.
    Allocate Executable Memory: It allocates a memory region with execute permissions.
    Copy Payload into Memory: The payload binary data is copied into the allocated memory.
    Execute Payload: The dropper casts the memory address to a function pointer and executes the payload.

2.2 Payload

The payload is a self-contained piece of code designed to be loaded into memory and executed. It performs a specific task (e.g., printing a message) and exits. The payload is implemented in multiple languages to demonstrate versatility.
3. Implementation
3.1 Assembly Payload

Purpose: Prints a message to the console and exits.

Source Code:

asm

section .data
    msg db 'Payload executed successfully!', 0x0A, 0

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Print the message to the console
    mov eax, 4          ; syscall: sys_write
    mov ebx, 1          ; file descriptor: stdout
    mov ecx, msg        ; pointer to message
    mov edx, 31         ; length of message
    int 0x80            ; make syscall

    ; Exit the program
    mov eax, 1          ; syscall: sys_exit
    xor ebx, ebx        ; exit code 0
    int 0x80            ; make syscall

Compilation:

bash

nasm -f elf32 payload.asm -o payload.o
ld -m elf_i386 payload.o -o payload
objcopy -O binary payload payload.bin

3.2 C++ Payload

Purpose: Prints a message to the console and exits. This version is compiled as a shared library.

Source Code:

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" void execute_payload() {
    std::cout << "Payload executed successfully!" << std::endl;
    std::exit(0);
}

Compilation:

bash

g++ -shared -fPIC -o payload.so payload.cpp
objcopy -O binary payload.so payload.bin

3.3 Dropper in C++

Purpose: Loads the payload from a binary file into memory, sets memory permissions, and executes it.

Source Code:

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    // Read payload binary data
    std::ifstream file("payload.bin", std::ios::binary | std::ios::ate);
    if (!file.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open payload file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    std::streamsize size = file.tellg();
    file.seekg(0, std::ios::beg);
    char* buffer = new char[size];
    if (!file.read(buffer, size)) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to read payload file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    file.close();

    // Allocate executable memory
    void* exec_mem = mmap(nullptr, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC,
                          MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
    if (exec_mem == MAP_FAILED) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to allocate executable memory." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Copy payload into executable memory
    memcpy(exec_mem, buffer, size);

    // Execute the payload
    typedef void (*payload_func)();
    payload_func func = reinterpret_cast<payload_func>(exec_mem);
    func();

    // Clean up
    munmap(exec_mem, size);
    delete[] buffer;

    return 0;
}

Compilation:

bash

g++ -o dropper dropper.cpp

4. Execution

1. Prepare the Payload:

    Compile the payload source code into a binary file (payload.bin).

2. Prepare the Dropper:

    Compile the dropper source code into an executable (dropper).

3. Run the Dropper:

    Place payload.bin in the same directory as the dropper executable.
    Execute the dropper: ./dropper.

4. Expected Output:

    The payload will be loaded into memory and executed, printing the message: "Payload executed successfully!" to the console.

5. Security Considerations

    Memory Protection: Ensure that memory allocated for executing the payload has the correct permissions (read, write, execute).
    Error Handling: Implement error handling to manage issues with file operations and memory allocation.
    Testing: Test the dropper and payload in a controlled environment to ensure they work as expected and do not cause unintended side effects.

6. Summary

This dossier provides a comprehensive guide to implementing and executing a dropper and payload system. It includes details on creating a payload in multiple languages and a dropper capable of loading and executing the payload from memory. By following these instructions, you can build and test a self-contained payload and its execution environment.
